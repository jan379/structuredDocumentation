# How to structure user facing documentation

These are my reader notes written down in a 
shell script reading (Daniele Procida on documentation)[https://www.divio.com/blog/documentation/]. 

You can simply execute the script genSkeleton.sh and get a
directory structure you can fill with content + short summaries 
of the specific kind of what criteria might be right for different 
kind of user facing documentation.
